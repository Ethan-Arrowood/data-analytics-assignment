### Data Download

Download data from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Video_Games_5.json.gz)
Unzip this and place it in a `data` folder in the root of the project. Either delete this file after unzipping it or place it into a `compressed_data` folder so it is ignored by git.

### Overview
In this assignment, you will need to apply data analytics, using the tools introduced during the labs. You are required to study the Amazon products categories and analyze them through the reviews left by the consumers. The assignment consists of 3 parts. In the first part, you will need to understand data characteristics using data preparation and preprocessing techniques. In the second part, you will perform various data analysis techniques, including exploratory, statistical, and predictive ones. In the third part, you will need to evaluate your findings and determine appropriate future actions.
